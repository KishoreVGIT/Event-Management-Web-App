# Event-Management-Web-App

## Project Name and Description
Our project, the Event Management Web Application, addresses a current gap at Purdue
Fort Wayne, where the existing events page only allows students to view activities but does
not provide a way to RSVP or track attendance. This creates challenges for both students,
who cannot easily manage the events they want to attend, and organizers, who lack insight
into expected attendance. Our application provides a solution by offering a centralized
platform where students can browse events, RSVP, and view their participation history,
while organizers can create and manage events, set capacity limits, and track attendees.
Academically, this project is valuable because it allows our team to apply full-stack
development skills, integrating frontend, backend, database, authentication, testing, and
deployment into a cohesive product. As a product, it brings value to the Purdue Fort Wayne
community by enhancing student engagement and providing organizers with data to plan
more successful and well-attended events.

## Technology List
Our project will utilize a complete technology stack to meet the requirements of a full-stack
web application. The chosen tools include:
• Frontend: Next.js (user interface)
• Backend: Node.js with Express (server and business logic)
• Database: Firebase/PostgreSQL (store users, events, and RSVPs)
• Authentication: Secure login system using JWT or session-based methods
• Testing: Jest (for unit and integration tests)
• Deployment/Hosting: Vercel for frontend hosting, Render/Heroku for backend
deployment
• Version Control: GitHub (branches, pull requests, and collaborative workflows)

## Collaboration Plan
Our team will ensure smooth collaboration by establishing clear communication and task
management practices. We will hold meetings twice per week (after class and on
weekends) to track progress and discuss next steps. For communication, we will use a
dedicated group chat (Microsoft Teams/WhatsApp) for day-to-day updates and email for
formal communication. GitHub will be our primary collaboration platform for version
control and code sharing. We will also use MS Office/PowerPoint/Excel for planning &
presentation, as well as Jira to organize tasks, assign responsibilities, and track deadlines.
